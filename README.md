## DOC

MVP specification for building functionality in the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using Python classes:

### 1. Command Handler Class:
- Responsible for handling write operations or commands.
- Should have methods for each specific command.
- Receives the command as the input parameter and processes it accordingly.
- Performs business logic and updates the appropriate data models or services.

### 2. Query Handler Class:
- Responsible for handling read operations or queries.
- Should have methods for each specific query.
- Receives the query as the input parameter and retrieves the required data.
- Performs any necessary filtering, sorting, or aggregation on the data.

### 3. Command Model:
- Represents the data model for write operations or commands.
- Includes attributes that define the necessary fields for a command.
- Can have methods to validate and transform the data before persisting it.

### 4. Query Model:
- Represents the data model for read operations or queries.
- Includes attributes that define the required fields for a query response.
- Can include methods to format or transform the data before returning it.

### 5. Command Bus:
- Responsible for routing commands to the appropriate command handler.
- Maps the incoming command to the corresponding handler method based on the command type.
- Initiates the command processing and updates the data accordingly.

### 6. Query Bus:
- Responsible for routing queries to the appropriate query handler.
- Maps the incoming query to the corresponding handler method based on the query type.
- Executes the query processing and returns the requested data.

### 7. Repository:
- Responsible for persisting and retrieving data from the underlying storage.
- Provides methods to save, update, delete, and retrieve data models.
- Can implement an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with the database.

These classes form the foundation of the CQRS pattern implementation in Python and allow separation of write operations from read operations, improving scalability and performance.

## Environment

+ Docker
+ docker-compose.yaml

  
In this docker-compose.yml, two services are defined: app and db. The app service builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory. The volumes line specifies that the app folder should be mounted to the /app folder in the container. The app is mapped to port 8000.

The db service creates a Postgres database instance using the official Postgres Docker image. The Postgres container is given the environment variables for the Postgres user, password, and database. 

You can initiate the services by using the command `docker-compose up --build`.
